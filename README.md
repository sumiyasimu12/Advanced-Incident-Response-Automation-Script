# Advanced Incident Response Automation System

An advanced, automated incident response system designed to detect, prioritize, and respond to cybersecurity threats in real-time. By leveraging machine learning, threat intelligence integrations, and automated containment and rollback, this system minimizes response times, enhances detection accuracy, and improves system resilience.

## üìã Project Overview
This project follows a structured incident response lifecycle:
1. **Identification**: Detects and classifies incidents (malware, DDoS, ransomware, etc.) with real-time threat intelligence checks.
2. **Containment & Eradication**: Isolates and neutralizes threats based on severity, using machine learning for prioritization.
3. **Recovery & Rollback**: Automates system recovery and, if needed, restores pre-incident states.
4. **Lessons Learned**: Logs detailed incident reports and sends notifications for audit and compliance.

## üöÄ Key Features
- **Machine Learning-Based Threat Prioritization**: Dynamically assesses threat severity, optimizing response.
- **Real-Time Threat Intelligence**: Fetches data and reputation checks from external APIs.
- **Multi-Threaded Incident Management**: Manages multiple incidents simultaneously for high-frequency environments.
- **Comprehensive Logging & Notifications**: Logs each response stage and sends email notifications.
- **Rollback Mechanism**: Ensures system recovery by rolling back to the latest clean state.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sumiyasimu12/advanced-incident-response-automation.git
   ```
2. **Configure Settings**:
   - Set up your email server settings for notifications in the script.
   - Provide API keys and endpoints for threat intelligence and reputation checks.
   - Adjust the incident types and response actions as needed.

3. **Run the System**:
   ```bash
   python incident_response.py
   ```
   The system will handle and log incidents in real-time based on the configured parameters.
